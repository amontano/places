notes by mel riffe, started 16 june 2008:

1) for some reason after the postgres migration we can no longer do finder queries of the sort:  Feature.find_all_by_is_public(true); the generated sql is not correct: "is_public" = "t" (to paraphrase and summarize). substituting true with 1 works (false => 0).

2) don't understand the fascination with svn externals for plugins. i will be converting the non-uva plugins to their non-svn-external versions. will probably run into compatibility issues now that some of the plugins will be in a GIT repository. 

3) [Test Database is now getting created] the gis database integration is trickier then first thought; testing for all intents and purposes becomes disabled. because the postgis database requires special commands to create it, rails way of cloning the structure fails, essentially killing testing.  i need to figure out a way to hook into the spatial adapter to issue the correct commands when creating the test database.

4) i also want to include all the required gems into vendor/gems. i will need to make sure the paths are in the config.load_path. i think i will also need to look into the require_gems.rb initializer. this will give us a nicely contained, constrained application that could be, theoretically speaking, dropped where ever ruby and mongrel are deployed. i started with GeoRuby. the initializer should only require gems needed for the application and not for plugins; the plugins will/should already contain their require statement. 

5) creating a postgis database from the command line consists of the following commands:

createdb test
createlang plpgsql test
psql -d test -f share/lwpostgis.sql
psql -d test -f share/spatial_ref_sys.sql

6) the SHAPES table, from the current dump, baffles me. ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PGError: ERROR:  relation "shapes_gid_seq" does not exist.

19 June 2008:

1) shapes table has no primary key; GID looks a likely candidate. shapes table has duplicate rows for some FIDs (over 3900 instances of multiple FIDs). schema dump doesn't assign an SRID to the geometry column because there's no corresponding information in the geometry_cloumns table - huh?

SELECT FID, COUNT(*)
FROM SHAPES
GROUP BY FID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

2) the shapes gid column is defined to use a sequence that doesn't exist. there should probably be an index on the FID column now that the two datasets comingle.

3) gather up all your questions about the SHAPES table and send them to adam, cc'ing everybody and their brother.

4) multipoint testing in fixtures, using data from the export, causes TM to stop responding. too much data


1 July 2008:

sequential feature ids: i'm thinking i won't use a migration but will use a script that will have to get executed after deployment.  i could probably wrap it up in a rake task, removing it or disabling it once it's been executed.

the feature ids, or pids, exist in two places: features.pid and shapes.fid.  for each features.pid there are zero or more shapes.fid.

no, on second thought, i will try to use the migration framework.

no, on third thought, i think i have to do this in a SQL script - darned constraints

10:17:49 > Updated to revision 6046.

new action items!

Until the database is taken care of, perform the following steps AFTER a database restore and BEFORE running the tests:
* remove the views
* add an entry in geometry_columns for shapes.geometry
* remove 7-char limit on shapes.fid
* gid as shapes_pkey
