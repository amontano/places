######### Relation Browser (uses relation browser rails plugin) #########
	module ActiveRecord
	  module Acts
	    module NestedSet
	      module ClassMethods

	      end
	    end
	  end
	end

	For acts_as_family_tree to have a compatible interface to relation browser plugin:

	# ActsAsNestedSet (RelationBrowserPlugin)

	extend ActiveRecord::Acts::NestedSet::ClassMethods

	alias_method :orig_children, :children

	def children
	c = orig_children
	(c.map(&:children) + c).compact.flatten.uniq
	end

	# Returns a set of itself and all of its nested children
	def full_set
	children + [self]
	end

	# Returns a set of only this entryâ€˜s immediate children
	def direct_children
	orig_children
	end

	This will breaks the rest of the application though :( - For the relation browser plugin to work, the source code (or indirect manipulation) of the code would be needed.



######### ACTS AS SOLR #########
	* The following seems to work (in controller)
	@context_feature = Feature.find(params[:context_id]) rescue nil
	@results = Feature.find_by_solr(params[:filter].blank? ? '[* TO *]' : params[:filter])
	@collection  = @results.docs
	@total_hits = @results.total_hits

	* And the pagination in the view:
	<%= will_paginate(
		WillPaginate::Collection.new((params[:page]||1),
		(params[:products_per_page]||10),@total_hits)
	) -%>
