8 July 2008:

Features have Feature Type and Related Features should be grouped according to this type.  The request is that grouped features provide a summary count for its feature type which, upon clicking, would expand to display the grouped features.

For example:

Feature A
 Related Features:
  Monasteries (2)
   Monastery 1
   Monastery 2
  Churches (2)
  Buildings (3)
  
  
Items to research:
 - grouping by feature type
 - sorting by feature type
 - counting feature type
 - div hiding/showing


A features children and descendants will be different sizes but if a feature has no children then it also has no descendants [confirmed by matt mitchell].
